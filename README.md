A Project in Python 3.9 using the Tkinter module I made for my Class 12 Boards Computer Science Project

Hi, I am Siddh Jain and I love coding.
As soon as I heard about the class 12 project, I knew I had to make something that stood out, yet inside the boundaries set by my school.
All Coding is pure Python and can be run in any Python Code notebook(s) such as IDLE, Anaconda, SPyder, etc.
Feel free to use any of this code wherever necessary.
Signing off, 
Siddh A Jain.
